## Background
This system is a cost manager RESTful API system, developed with NodeJS and Express framework.  
It includes also a frontend application, using React.  
The system is deployed on AWS, and accessible through this link:  
Frontend - http://cost-manager.amazonaws.com  
Backend - http://cost-manager.amazonaws.com:3000  

For API usage reference, visit the Swagger page:

## Disclaimers
If it was production grade system, of course that I would have use certificates for HTTPS, but we skipped this 
due to costs considerations.
